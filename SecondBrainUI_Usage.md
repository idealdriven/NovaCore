# Using the Second Brain UI

This document provides guidance on how to use the Second Brain UI application to interact with your knowledge management system.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: 
   - Download and install the application for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
   - On first launch, you'll be prompted to select your Second Brain directory

2. **Interface Overview**:
   - **Left Panel**: File Explorer - browse your Second Brain directory structure
   - **Middle Panel**: Note Viewer/Editor - view and edit the selected notes
   - **Right Panel**: Chat Interface - interact with your Second Brain using natural language

## Chat Interface

The most powerful way to interact with your Second Brain is through the chat interface. Use these command prefixes:

### Content Creation

- **[Thought] your thought here** - Creates a new fleeting note with your thought
- **[Daily] your daily entry** - Adds content to today's daily note
- **[Weekly] your weekly reflection** - Adds content to this week's note
- **[Monthly] your monthly summary** - Adds content to this month's note
- **[Project: Project Name] update** - Updates a specific project note

### Search and Retrieval

- **Find notes about topic** - Searches your Second Brain for notes related to a topic
- **Summarize my notes on topic** - Provides a summary of your notes on a specific topic
- **Review my notes from timeframe** - Shows notes from a specific time period

### Example Interactions

#### Creating a Fleeting Note
```
[Thought] I need to explore the connection between regular exercise and productivity. There seems to be research showing that even brief periods of physical activity can boost cognitive function.
```

#### Updating a Project
```
[Project: Website Redesign] Today I finished the wireframes for the homepage and about sections. Still need to work on the contact form design. Next steps: review with the team on Friday.
```

#### Finding Related Notes
```
Find notes about productivity techniques
```

## File Management

The file explorer allows you to:
1. Browse your complete Second Brain directory structure
2. Click on any markdown file to view its contents
3. Edit any note directly in the application
4. See the changes reflected immediately in your local file system

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific with your commands** - The more specific your prefix and content, the better the application can process your request
2. **Review the Commands directory** in your Second Brain for a complete list of available commands
3. **Use the editor** for major revisions to your notes
4. **Set up regular reviews** using the Weekly and Monthly prefixes to maintain your knowledge system

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your Second Brain path is correctly configured
2. Check that the directory structure matches the expected format
3. Restart the application if file changes aren't showing up
4. If search isn't working well, try more specific search terms
