## Categorization Guidelines

When categorizing content into these folders, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Primary vs. Secondary Categories**: Content often fits multiple categories. Choose the primary category based on the main focus of the content, and consider creating links to secondary categories.

2. **Specificity Principle**: Place content in the most specific appropriate folder rather than a more general one.

3. **Purpose-Based Categorization**: Consider the purpose of the note (reference, project, reflection) when choosing a category.

4. **Evolution of Categories**: As your Second Brain grows, categories may need to evolve. Be open to reorganizing and refining your folder structure.

5. **Cross-Linking**: Use links liberally to connect related content across different folders.

## Natural Language Categorization Cues

The AI assistant will look for these linguistic cues to determine the appropriate folder:

### Topic Indicators
- Explicit mentions of categories ("my dream last night", "this recipe I tried")
- Subject-specific terminology ("character development" → Media, "workout routine" → Fitness)
- Action verbs associated with categories ("reading" → Literature/Books, "traveling" → Travel)

### Purpose Indicators
- Learning focus → Knowledge or Learning folders
- Creative expression → Creativity or Arts folders
- Personal reflection → Personal or Journal folders
- Planning and execution → Projects folders
- Collection and reference → Collections or Resources folders

### Temporal Indicators
- One-time experiences → appropriate topic folder
- Ongoing interests → Interests folders
- Regular practices → Lifestyle folders
- Future aspirations → Goals folder

The AI will analyze these cues in combination to determine the most appropriate categorization for your content.
